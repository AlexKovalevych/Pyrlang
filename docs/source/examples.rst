Examples!
=========

Talk is cheap! Show me some code!

Have a look in :doc:`getting_started` too!

Some examples are located in ``examples/`` directory. And there are convenient
``Makefile`` targets to call them, just use your Bash autocomplete when typing
``make example<TAB>``.

.. note::
    Some examples require a client and a server, these have two parts: example A
    and example B.
